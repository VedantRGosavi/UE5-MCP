# AI Integration in MCP

## Overview
MCP integrates AI-powered automation for procedural scene generation, asset creation, gameplay programming, and optimization. This document details how AI APIs interact with Blender-MCP and UE5-MCP to streamline development workflows.

---

## **1. AI-Powered Features**
### **1.1 Scene & Asset Generation**
- AI generates environments and assets based on natural language descriptions.
- Example:
  ```bash
  mcp.generate_scene "A cyberpunk city with flying cars and neon lights."
  ```
- AI-assisted material generation:
  ```bash
  mcp.generate_texture "metal_surface" "scratched metal with rust."
  ```

### **1.2 Gameplay Logic Automation**
- AI can generate Unreal Engine Blueprints for game mechanics.
- Example:
  ```bash
  mcp.generate_blueprint "Create an NPC that follows the player and attacks on sight."
  ```

### **1.3 AI-Assisted Debugging & Optimization**
- Detects performance issues in levels and assets.
- Example:
  ```bash
  mcp.profile_performance "open_world_map"
  ```
- AI suggests optimizations for lighting, physics, and assets.

## **2. AI API Providers**
MCP supports multiple AI providers for automation:
- **OpenAI GPT**: Natural language processing and logic generation.
- **Stable Diffusion**: AI-generated textures and materials.
- **Claude AI**: Context-aware asset placement and world-building.

### **Configuration in MCP**
Modify `mcp_config.json` to set AI provider:
```json
{
  "ai_integration": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "api_key": "your-api-key"
  }
}
```

## **3. AI Workflow in MCP**
### **Step 1: User Inputs Command**
- Example: Generate a medieval village scene.
  ```bash
  mcp.generate_scene "A medieval village with a central marketplace and castle."
  ```

### **Step 2: AI Processes Request**
- AI interprets the command and creates procedural geometry, assets, and textures.

### **Step 3: MCP Applies AI Output**
- Objects are placed logically with textures and physics settings.
- Users can refine outputs using additional commands.

---

## **4. AI Safety & Control**
- **Context Awareness**: AI understands scene context to avoid illogical placements.
- **User Control**: Developers can override AI-generated content.
- **Security**: AI API keys are stored securely in `mcp_config.json`.

For additional configuration, see `configurations.md`.
