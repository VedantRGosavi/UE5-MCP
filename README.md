# UE5-MCP (Model Control Protocol)

A Model Control Protocol (MCP) integration that enables AI-driven scene generation in Blender and seamless transfer to Unreal Engine 5 for game level creation. This project builds upon [BlenderMCP](https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp) to provide an end-to-end pipeline for AI-driven game level creation.

## Overview

This project implements a two-stage Model Control Protocol that:

1. Uses BlenderMCP to generate 3D scenes in Blender from text/image prompts using AI
2. Transfers and converts these scenes into game levels in Unreal Engine 5

The pipeline allows creators to rapidly prototype and create game levels using natural language or reference images, streamlining the level design process.
