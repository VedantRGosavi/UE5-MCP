# UE5-MCP (Model Control Protocol)

## Overview

UE5-MCP (Model Control Protocol) is designed to integrate AI-driven automation into Blender and Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) workflows. This project builds upon [BlenderMCP](https://github.com/ahujasid/blender-mcp) to provide an end-to-end pipeline for AI-driven game level creation, enhancing level design, asset management, and gameplay programming.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Scene Generation** (via BlenderMCP):
  - Text-to-Scene conversion in Blender
  - Image-to-Scene reference-based generation
  - Material and texture management
  - Automated scene composition
  - PolyHaven asset integration
- **Unreal Engine Integration**:
  - Automated scene import
  - Game level conversion
  - Material and lighting transfer
  - Level optimization utilities
  - Blueprint-based scene manipulation
- **Asset Management & Creation**: 
  - Generates and modifies 3D models, textures, and materials using AI
  - Workflow automation for asset transfers between Blender and UE5
- **Gameplay Programming & Debugging**: 
  - Assists in Blueprint scripting
  - Performance profiling
  - Automated debugging for UE5

## Prerequisites

- Blender (latest stable version)
- Unreal Engine 5 (UE5)
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (specified in `dependencies.md`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/UE5-MCP.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure settings (refer to `configurations.md`)
4. Run MCP within Blender or UE5 as per the workflow instructions (`workflow.md`)

## Usage

- For **Blender**: Use Blender-MCP to automate scene creation and asset generation
- For **Unreal Engine 5**: Utilize UE5-MCP for automated level design, asset integration, and debugging
