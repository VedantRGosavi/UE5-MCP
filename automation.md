# MCP Automation

## Overview
This document details how scripts are automated for scene generation and asset transfer between Blender and Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). MCP leverages AI-driven automation to enhance efficiency and reduce manual workload.

## **1. Automation in Blender**
### **1.1 Scene Generation**
#### Automated Process:
1. User inputs a description: `mcp.generate_scene "A medieval village with cobblestone streets and torches."`
2. AI processes the request and creates procedural geometry.
3. Assets (e.g., houses, roads, lights) are placed with logical spatial relationships.
4. Textures and materials are automatically applied.

### **1.2 Asset Management**
#### Automated Tasks:
- **Texture Generation:** AI generates and applies textures.
  ```bash
  mcp.generate_texture "castle_wall" "weathered stone"
  ```
- **Batch Processing:** Multiple objects processed in parallel for efficiency.
- **Export Optimization:** Ensures assets meet UE5â€™s performance requirements.
  ```bash
  mcp.export_asset "bridge_model" "fbx" "./exports/bridge.fbx"
  ```

## **2. Automation in Unreal Engine 5**
### **2.1 Procedural Level Design**
#### Automated Process:
1. **Terrain Creation:**
   ```bash
   mcp.generate_terrain 2000 2000 "high"
   ```
2. **Foliage & Object Placement:**
   ```bash
   mcp.populate_level "trees" 1000
   ```
3. **AI-Driven Layout Refinements:** AI adjusts placements for performance and aesthetics.

### **2.2 Blueprint Automation**
#### Automated Tasks:
- **Generating Game Logic:**
  ```bash
  mcp.generate_blueprint "Create a trigger that opens a door when the player is near."
  ```
- **Debugging & Performance Optimization:**
  ```bash
  mcp.profile_performance "desert_map"
  ```

## **3. AI-Driven Enhancements**
### **3.1 Predictive Asset Placement**
- AI suggests optimal placements based on game world data.
- Example: Placing torches along pathways in a medieval setting.

### **3.2 Automated Testing**
- AI runs simulations to test level design and gameplay logic.
- Detects performance bottlenecks and suggests improvements.

---

## **4. Best Practices**
- Use automation for repetitive tasks to speed up development.
- Leverage AI to refine asset placement and game logic.
- Optimize exported assets to maintain high performance in UE5.
