# MCP Architecture

## Overview
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is structured to integrate AI-driven automation into both Blender and Unreal Engine 5 (UE5), enabling procedural generation, asset management, and gameplay programming assistance. The architecture ensures a modular, extensible, and high-performance system for developers.

## High-Level Design
MCP consists of multiple core components:

### 1. **Core Processing Layer**
- Handles AI interactions for procedural generation and automation.
- Communicates with external AI models (e.g., Claude, GPT, Stable Diffusion) for intelligent asset creation.
- Manages logic for interpreting natural language instructions into executable tasks.

### 2. **Blender-MCP Module**
- Integrates with Blender’s API to automate scene creation, asset modification, and material generation.
- Supports Python scripting for automation of procedural modeling and texture synthesis.
- Facilitates direct asset transfers to UE5 via standardized formats.

### 3. **UE5-MCP Module**
- Works within Unreal Engine 5 to streamline level design, Blueprint automation, and debugging.
- Uses UE5's Python API and Blueprints to modify in-engine assets and gameplay logic.
- Implements AI-driven tools for terrain generation, foliage placement, and environment structuring.

### 4. **Middleware Communication Layer**
- Bridges Blender and UE5, ensuring seamless asset migration.
- Manages API authentication and context tracking across multiple platforms.
- Provides an abstraction layer for AI interactions and script automation.

### 5. **Data Storage & Configuration Management**
- Stores metadata, user settings, and procedural generation templates.
- Supports configuration presets for different types of workflows.

## Interaction Flow
1. **User Inputs Command** → MCP interprets and processes the command.
2. **AI Generation & Processing** → AI models generate assets, scripts, or modifications.
3. **Execution in Blender or UE5** → The processed results are applied to the active scene.
4. **User Iteration & Refinement** → Users refine outputs with additional instructions or modifications.

## Extensibility & Future Enhancements
- **AI Model Enhancements**: Future iterations will support fine-tuned AI models for domain-specific tasks.
- **Expanded UE5 Integration**: More complex Blueprint automation and performance profiling features.
- **Cloud-Based Processing**: Enabling remote AI processing for large-scale asset generation.

This architecture ensures flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in integrating AI-assisted workflows into Blender and Unreal Engine 5.
