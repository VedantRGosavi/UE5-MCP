# MCP Workflow

## Overview
This document explains how different components of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) interact, particularly between Blender-MCP and Unreal Engine 5-MCP. It outlines the end-to-end workflow, from asset creation in Blender to integration in UE5, along with AI-driven automation processes.

## **1. End-to-End Workflow**

### **Step 1: Creating Assets in Blender**
1. Open Blender and load the MCP plugin.
2. Use `mcp.generate_scene "description"` to create a procedural scene.
3. Add objects to the scene using `mcp.add_object "object_type" x y z`.
4. Apply procedural textures using `mcp.generate_texture "object_name" "texture_type"`.
5. Export assets using `mcp.export_asset "object_name" "format" "filepath"` for UE5.

### **Step 2: Transferring Assets to UE5**
1. Import Blender-exported `.fbx`, `.obj`, or `.gltf` files into UE5.
2. Use the MCP tool within UE5 to process and optimize assets.
3. Assign materials and textures automatically using MCP texture mapping.

### **Step 3: Level Design Automation in UE5**
1. Generate procedural terrain using `mcp.generate_terrain width height detail_level`.
2. Populate levels with assets using `mcp.populate_level "asset_type" density`.
3. AI refines and suggests placements based on terrain and gameplay requirements.

### **Step 4: Blueprint Automation and Gameplay Logic**
1. Use `mcp.generate_blueprint "logic_description"` to create gameplay scripts.
2. Test and iterate within UE5’s editor.
3. Debug performance issues with `mcp.profile_performance "level_name"`.

### **Step 5: Finalizing and Exporting the Project**
1. Optimize assets using LOD generation and compression.
2. Run AI-assisted debugging to refine gameplay mechanics.
3. Package the project for deployment.

## **2. Interaction Between Components**
### **Blender ↔ UE5 Integration**
- MCP automates asset transfer between Blender and UE5.
- Ensures textures and materials remain consistent.

### **AI-Driven Automation**
- AI assists in procedural generation, object placement, and gameplay programming.
- MCP leverages AI for predictive asset placement and optimization.

## **3. Best Practices**
- Keep assets modular for easier reuse.
- Use procedural generation where possible to reduce manual workload.
- Leverage AI-assisted debugging for optimized performance.
